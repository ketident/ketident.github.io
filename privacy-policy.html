    <ul>
      <li>For Another Trello for Gmail, nothing is stored or shared in the add-on with the exception of auth tokens for Trello which powers the add-on to post the message to Trello as a card only when the Gmail users clicks the button to post</li>
      <li>For Post to Social Media, the add-on only stores tokens that grant the add-on the right to post to social media on user's behalf. Where possible such tokens are automatically refreshed so that the user does not need to re-authorize. The image files from Google Drive are posted to social networks only when the user clicks the button. Nothing is shared to any social media without the user authorizing the add-on and enabling posting to specific social media. The add-on automatically populates the text to post from the Google Drive image metadata. This is text editable prior to being posted.</li>
